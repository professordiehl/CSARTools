You can access this report by going to the People link in your Canvas course. _**\r\n\r\nAn Access Report is what you get when you click on the People Navigation link in Canvas, followed by a student's name, and finally click on Access Report. It shows the number of times the student has viewed content or participated in the course. You can only return the access report for one student at a time.\r\n\r\nThis Chrome Extension allows you to obtain the raw data for all students in the course. You will need to manipulate the data to obtain anything useful from it.\r\n\r\nNote: The report may take a while to run, depending on the size of your class. The Access Report Data button is disabled while it is running.\r\n\r\n",
